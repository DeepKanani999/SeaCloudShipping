      "Tiles Adhesive Gold – Type 1T is a premium-grade, polymer-modified cementitious tile adhesive, formulated to comply with IS 15477:2019 – Type 1T (T1) standards. It is specifically designed for internal wall and floor applications, providing excellent adhesion for ceramic, glazed ceramic, and unglazed tiles in dry and intermittently wet areas such as kitchens and bathrooms.",

      "This adhesive offers enhanced bond strength, slip resistance, and extended open time, making it ideal for vertical installations where tile slippage must be minimized. The inclusion of high-quality polymers improves flexibility, water retention, and overall durability, helping the adhesive accommodate minor thermal and structural movements without cracking or debonding.",

      "Tiles Adhesive Gold – Type 1T is easy to mix and apply. It has a pot life of 90–120 minutes and an open time of at least 20 minutes, allowing for precise tile placement and adjustment. When applied with a notched trowel, it offers smooth workability and strong initial grab. Coverage ranges between 3–4 kg/m², depending on the substrate and trowel size.",

      "It can be applied on cementitious substrates like plaster, mortar beds, and concrete. Surfaces should be clean, dry (or slightly damp), level, and free from contaminants. Once mixed in a 3:1 powder-to-water ratio, the adhesive creates a uniform paste ready for immediate application.",

      "Available in 20 kg and 40 kg moisture-resistant bags, the product has a 12-month shelf life when stored in a cool, dry environment.",

      "Tiles Adhesive Gold – Type 1T is a reliable and efficient solution for professional internal tile installations, ensuring strong adhesion, reduced tile slippage, and long-lasting durability for residential and commercial spaces.",
